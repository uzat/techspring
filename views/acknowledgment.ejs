  <h1>Acknowledgment of Country</h1>
  <p>Techspring acknowledges the Traditional Owners of the lands on which we live and work — the Bunurong people of the Kulin Nation, here on the Mornington Peninsula, and all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples across Australia.</p>

  <p>We pay our respects to Elders past and present, and we honour the enduring connection of Indigenous peoples to Country, culture, and community.</p>

  <p>As an AI and technology business, we recognise our role in shaping futures — and we commit to listening, learning, and including Indigenous voices in the future we help build.</p>
